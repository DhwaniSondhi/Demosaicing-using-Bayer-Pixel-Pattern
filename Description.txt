The project can be run using either python or jupyter notebook:

1. Python File: code.py
   Required Libraries: OpenCV and numpy
   Working: 
   - Please keep the required images in the same folder as the code.
   - Please mention the input file name with extension in grey_image.
   - Please mention the actual file name with extension in colored_image.
   - In both cases, 2 images are generated.
   - The first image for each Part contains the actual, output and 3-channel noise image(noise divided in 3 channels).
   - The second image for each Part is the 1-channel noise image(Grey scale-noise accumulated in 1 channel).
   - Both images are described as Part A or B.
   - The images can be closed by pressing any keyboard key and will be saved in the same folder for reviewal.
  

2. 	Jupyter notebook
	Required Libraries: OpenCV, MatplotLib and numpy
	Working:
	- Please keep the required images in the same folder as the code.
	- Install the libraries and open the jupyter notebook.
	- Please mention the input file name with extension in grey_image.
	- Please mention the actual file name with extension in colored_image.
	- In both cases, 4 images are generated: actual, output and 3-channel noise image(noise divided in 3 channels) and 1-channel noise image(Grey scale-noise accumulated in 1 channel).
	- All images are saved and they are more clear than ones on Jupyter notebook.
